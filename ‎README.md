â€Ž# Purpose of test

I wrote this test to compare performance on linux network stack between GO and C. 
In folder `c_send_recv` you can find highly optimized udp sender and receiver written in C, this code was borrowed from this project https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-receive-a-million-packets/ and used as beau ideal that GO realization wants to be.

Go implements several methods to send UDP packets. There is a test for each - see usage in main.go
The different servers show different numbers so you should test your server by yourself.
But in general: 
 * the UDPConn.Write() is the slowest , on my box it almous 2 times slower then C sender.
 * the sendmmsg syscall implementation is fastest , and acts the same speed as C (even 5% faster on my box)
